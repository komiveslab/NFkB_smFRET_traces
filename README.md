NF-kappaB Single-Molecule FRET Traces 

There are five folders:
1. free - smFRET traces of free NF-kappaB
2. DNA - smFRET traces of DNA-bound NF-kappaB
3. WT_IkBa - smFRET traces of wildtype IkBalpha-bound NF-kappaB
4. 5xPEST_IkBa - smFRET traces of 5xPEST IKBalpha-bound NF-kappaB
5. DNA_titration - smFRET traces of DNA-bound NF-kappaB with varying solution DNA concentrations

In each folder, there might be subfolders stable/ and fluctuating/, each containing traces classified as stable or fluctuating respectively.

Datapoints of each background and donor leakage corrected single-molecule trace are stored in .dat, with the three columns to be Time (sec), Donor Fluorescence (a.u.), and Acceptor Fluorescence (a.u.).
Plots of individual traces are stored as .png files.
